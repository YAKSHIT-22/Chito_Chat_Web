# Chito_Chat_Web

Recently, I've been working on a project to Chito_Chat_App which is a Chat Room for public use this project allows people to form a chat room for themselves and chat with their friends or use it for some professional work.

Also I'd like to state that this is not a new idea to work on but building projects like this have been great learning experience for me .

Building the projects while learning the stuff helps a lot in understanding the concepts in much depth and see their practical implementations.
